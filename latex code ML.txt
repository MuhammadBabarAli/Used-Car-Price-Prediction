\section{Overview}
This report presents findings from a logistic regression analysis aimed at exploring the relationship between predictor variables and the likelihood of disease occurrence in patients post-transplant.

\section{Introduction}
The onset of chronic kidney disease (CKD) following liver transplantation is a significant complication that severely impacts patient survival. Pediatric patients who undergo liver transplantation require long-term monitoring, as impaired renal function is a recognized issue in this population. Genetic polymorphisms in genes such as CYP3A5 and MDR-1 have been linked to renal dysfunction in liver transplant recipients. Despite effective immunosuppressive regimens, acute rejection after orthotopic liver transplantation occurs in a considerable number of patients, raising concerns about associated renal complications.

\section{Model Summary}
The logistic regression model utilized the following predictor variables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item TST (Years Since Transplant): A continuous variable indicating the number of years since transplant.
    \item Sex: A categorical variable representing the gender of the patient.
    \item Type: A categorical variable describing the genetic type of the patient's condition post-transplant.
\end{itemize}


\section{Methodology}
The binary logistic model formulation was used for the analysis, and missing entries for TST were handled as outlined in the instructions. The analysis was performed using a software system.

\section{Odds Ratios}
The odds ratios for each predictor variable, along with interpretations, are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item TST: For each additional year since transplant, the odds of disease occurrence increase by approximately 1.52 times (OR = 1.52).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Interpretation: Patients further out from their transplant date are at increased odds of developing the disease compared to those closer to the transplant date.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Sex (Female): Females have odds of disease occurrence approximately 1.09 times higher than males (OR = 1.09).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Interpretation: Gender does not significantly affect disease odds, with females only slightly more predisposed than males.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Type (Genetic Type):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Leu/Pro: Patients with the Leu/Pro genetic type have odds of disease occurrence approximately 7.81 times higher than those with other types (OR = 7.81).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Interpretation: Genetic type strongly influences disease susceptibility, with Leu/Pro carriers significantly more likely to develop the disease.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Pro/Pro: Patients with the Pro/Pro genetic type have odds of disease occurrence approximately 6.48 times higher than those with other types (OR = 6.48).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Interpretation: Pro/Pro carriers also show a significantly increased likelihood of disease compared to other genetic types.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Time Since Transplant Comparison}
The specific odds increase for patients at 3 years and 7 years post-transplant was found to be progressively higher.

\section{Comparing Odds for Different Durations Since Transplant}
To further explore the impact of time since transplant on disease odds:

\subsection*{For TST = 3 years:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Odds increase approximately 3.48 times (OR = 3.48).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{For TST = 7 years:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Odds increase approximately 18.39 times (OR = 18.39).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Comparison:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Patients 7 years post-transplant have approximately 5.28 times higher odds of disease compared to patients at 3 years post-transplant.
\end{itemize}

This comparison underscores the progressive nature of disease risk with increasing years post-transplant.

\section{Model Performance Evaluation}
The model's performance was assessed using test data, and the performance metrics and statistical significance details are included in the screenshots.

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, the logistic regression analysis highlights significant associations between predictor variables (TST, Sex, Type) and disease occurrence post-transplant. Patients with longer durations since transplant, certain genetic types (Leu/Pro, Pro/Pro), and possibly female gender are identified as having increased odds of developing the disease. These findings are crucial for informing clinical management and personalized care strategies for post-transplant patients.
This report provides a comprehensive overview of the logistic regression findings and their implications in assessing disease risk post-transplant.
